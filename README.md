This is a texture pack that only changes playing cards and makes them more straightforward and hopefully easier to read. It is an accessibility aimed texture pack that I made based on what I found to be easiest to read, personally. Hopefully others will find it useful too.

Install this with <a href="https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded">steamodded</a>. Then for to your Mods folder (may need to create it) in C:\Users\[name]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\ and put the .lua file and asset folder into that folder. You should see it in your mods menu and in game.
